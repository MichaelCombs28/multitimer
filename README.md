# Multitimer

Manage multiple normal and interval timers within a single app.
Written using [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and [Capacitor JS](https://capacitorjs.com/)

## Overview

Never meant to publish this thing, but a couple of friends pushed me to. A special thanks to [Alyssa Aguilar](https://www.instagram.com/ms_mambo/?hl=en) for being kind
enough to do the UX!

The goal was to create a multiplatform app, but make it look like an IOS app. Seems to be ok enough for android.

## Installation

Make sure you install [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) (easiest bundled with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/))

```
yarn install
yarn android-dev # or yarn ios-dev
```
